# Flask Docker/Heroku Sample App
Sample flask Docker Compose project with heroku deployment configuration
## Getting started
### Local Development
#### Build the image:
```console
$ docker-compose build
```
### Initialize the Database
[Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are used to manage db schema and migrations.
```console
$ docker-compose run web_app flask db upgrade
```
The command may fail on the first try if the database container is slow to boot up. If it failed, simply rerun the command again.
Alternatively you can use this command instead:
```console
$ docker-compose run web_app ./wait-for-pg.sh db flask
```
### 3. Start the dev server
```console
$ docker-compose up
```
This will run the flask development web server for `web_app/app.py`
The default runs on port 5000 by default for development. Open `localhost:5000` on the browser to view the app. 
You can now start adding code to `app.py`.  The flask development web server is configure to reload on code change.

Hit `CTRL-C` to exit.

### 4. Installing additional packages 
Uses `pyenv` to manage depency versions but not for virtual environments.
```console
$ docker-compose run web_app pyenv install [package]
```
We still need to rebuild the image if we installed a dependency:
```console
$ docker-compose build
```

## Deploying to Heroku:
### 1. Setup Heroku-CLI
See official Docs: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
### 2. Commit your changes to Git:
If you did not clone this repo, make sure to have git initialized on the root directory (where `heroku.yml` lives).
Commit your changes to Git.
```
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Commit message"
```
### 3. Create the heroku app and deploy:
Upgrade to heroku-cli beta and install plugin-manifest
```console
$ heroku update beta
$ heroku plugins:install @heroku-cli/plugin-manifest
```
Create the heroku app
```console
$ heroku create [your-app-name] --manifest
```
Deploy the app via git
```console
$ git push heroku master
```
This will rebuild the docker image and deploy it to heroku. It may take while to complete the rebuild. 

### Open your Web App in the browser:
```
$ heroku open
```
